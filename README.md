# tailscale-dev/video-caddy-custom-domains

This repo contains the supporting materials for a video on the Tailscale YouTube channel about using Caddy with custom domains in conjunction with Tailscale to provide secure remote access to self-hosted services.

[![Remotely access and share your self-hosted services](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Vt4PDUXB_fg/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Vt4PDUXB_fg)

We're going to use Tailscale and the reverse proxy Caddy to share self-hosted services on your Tailnet with friends family.

In today's video we focus on Immich - a self-hosted photo backup tool, Audiobookshelf - an audiobook server, and Jellyfin - an open source media server.

Choose your own adventure in today's video and use it as a resource to share with friends or relatives who you'd like to be access your services. If you're looking for the chapter to send your remote users to, it's at 10:44 "instructions for remote users".
